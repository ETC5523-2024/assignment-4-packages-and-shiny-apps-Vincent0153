Hi all! This is my first R-package and R-shiny apps.

The R-package is called "marchmadness" and you can use the dataset inside it 
and have some explorations about the data.

The R-package and shiny apps are in the folder "marchmadness", please see more info inside it.

Hope you enjoy the package, cheers!
