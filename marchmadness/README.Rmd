# marchmadness

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of marchmadness is to analyze each team's performance and determine whether historical performance will have an effect on public picks for each team. Thus, this dataset could give you an insight and enable you have a prediction on the final ranking of each team. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of marchmadness from [GitHub](https://github.com/ETC5523-2024/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-Vincent0153/tree/main/marchmadness) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ETC5523-2024/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-Vincent0153/tree/main/marchmadness")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(marchmadness)
data("march_madness_dataset")
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r marchmadness}
summary(march_madness_dataset)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r power, echo = FALSE}
plot(march_madness_dataset$POWER)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
